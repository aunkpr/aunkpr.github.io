<p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Alexandra Newman, I am a Childrenâ€™s and Youth Services Manager for a public library in Northwest Arkansas. I obtained a BA in Art history from the University of Arkansas in 2021. I am currently my graduate degree at the University of Missouri.</p>
<p>Here you will find a sum of my work within the School of Information Science & Learning Technologies, along with a culmination of my work history. This website will demonstrate the principles, ethics, and values I have learned, and will list the professional and educational goals that I have maintained throughout my time at the University of Missouri. I am passionate about the role libraries have in society and the potential to impact communities through a public and private sphere. I hope that through this tool you will be able to witness that I am a library professional that believes in the power of literacy and the impact that accessible information has on communities. I am excited to share my love of libraries and expand my skills to teach others. 
    Look around and enjoy learning about me through my portfolio!
