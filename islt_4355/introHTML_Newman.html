<title>Welcome to Alexandra Newman's Website</title>

    Hello everyone! My name is Alexandra Newman. I have a bachelor’s degree in Art History and am pursuing a Master’s in Library Information Science (MLIS). I am a Children’s Librarian for a public library in Northwest Arkansas and have worked in public libraries for 5 years. This will be my first interaction with website development. I hope to gain new web design and development skills that I can directly apply to library programming for my community. In my current role, I am in charge of creating special programs that sometimes involve customizing websites to accommodate specific program needs. This course will allow me to gain a foundational understanding of these resources and become more confident when interacting with them. Surprisingly enough, I am not an avid reader. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, painting, hiking, biking, dancing, and spending time with my partner and two dogs, Thea and Veador.
