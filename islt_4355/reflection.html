<h2>Experience in the Library Profession</h2>
    <p class="no-indent"> My experience in the library world has been very fulfilling as I have gotten to learn how 
    important library spaces are for the development of society and how they have changed 
    drastically over time. I have been fortunate enough to work in public libraries that promote 
    professional growth and various learning opportunities across departments. My study experience 
    in School of Information Science & Learning Technologies has been short, but I have learned 
    that there is a balance that is needed between my studies, my full-time position, and my personal 
    life. It has been incredible seeing how my program encourages students to use real scenarios and 
    apply them to our studies. Although I am still in the foundational stage of my degree, I look 
    forward to the things I will learn that be added to my tool belt. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What have I learned</h2>
    <p>Although my time has been short, I have already learned a great amount. Through my 
    Foundations of Library Science course, I was able to better understand the standards that are 
    expected from libraries all over. I have been able to connect with library professionals outside of 
    my area and have learned how real events impact our profession in immeasurable ways. In my 
    Intro to Technologies course, I learned a great deal about the impact of developing technologies 
    and its effect on how libraries have transformed over time. Through my program I hope to learn 
    new skills that I may directly apply to my role at my public library. </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
    <h2>How I have improved</h2>
    <p>While I have started to learn a more structured side of library professions, I have noticed that the 
    courses I have taken have already benefited me in understanding the value of my profession. 
    Knowing and upholding the fundamental values and ethics of librarianship has helped me 
    navigate through real challenges that I am facing in the workplace. At a time where public 
    library spaces are being tested by censorship, it has been incredibly helpful to rely on what I have 
    learned to support my role. I have also learned to reach for help from others within my 
    profession, as they go through similar experiences. </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<h2>Goals for the future</h2>
    <p>As someone who holds a librarian title, a big goal for me is to complete my degree and feel 
    confident in my current role. I look forward to learning about other areas within the public and 
    private sphere that may spark new interest. As someone who has a passion for art and design, a 
    goal of mine is to explore collection and archival avenues within library spaces. I have enjoyed 
    my time in ISLT, and I hope that getting my degree will allow me to serve my community even 
    more.
