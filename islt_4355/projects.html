        <p>As the Children's Librarian at a public library, I oversee the planning and execution of our annual Summer Reading Program. This exciting 6-week program is designed to promote literacy among all age groups throughout the summer months, and it's a major undertaking that requires careful planning and coordination. Each week, we offer a variety of engaging programs and events to keep our city/county patrons inspired and motivated. We're proud to work closely with community partners to support local groups and invite vendors to offer enriching and educational opportunities for our patrons.</p>
        <p>In 2022, our Summer Reading Program had the theme of "Oceans of Possibilities." As someone who was new to organizing the program, I gained a wealth of valuable experience and knowledge that I'll carry with me going forward.</p>

        <h2>Collection Development</h2>
      </section>
      <div class="projectcontent">
        <p>As a Children's Librarian specializing in Collection Development, my role is to carefully curate a collection of materials that cater to the unique needs and interests of the young patrons in my community. I place a strong emphasis on ensuring that our collection is inclusive, diverse, and reflective of the children we serve. To accomplish this, I: Regularly conduct needs assessments Solicit feedback from teachers, parents, and other community members Survey our patrons Stay current with emerging trends and topics in children's literature Proactively seek out materials that showcase characters and themes that represent a variety of cultures, backgrounds, and experiences
        <p>I firmly believe that a diverse and inclusive collection is crucial in promoting a passion for reading and learning in children, and I take great pride in my work to ensure that our collection embodies this principle.</p>
        <p>The following charts display the circulation statistics of the children's collection since taking over in 2022. Family patron statistics have surpassed our pre-covid numbers, which directly reflects on my department and our evolving collection.</p>

        <h2>Leadership Advocacy</h2>
      </section>
      <div class="projectcontent">
        <p>I recognized the importance of creating a space for teens to have a voice in the services and programming we offer. That's why I decided to create a teen advisory board for our public library. I worked to recruit a diverse group of teens from the community who were passionate about reading, learning, and advocating for their peers. Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, we were able to collaborate on new programming ideas, suggest materials to add to our collection, and provide feedback on the services we offer. Not only did this help us to better serve our teen patrons, but it also helped to empower these young adults and give them a sense of ownership over their library. It was incredibly rewarding to see the impact that this advisory board had on our programming and services, and I believe it will continue to be a valuable resource for years to come.</p>
