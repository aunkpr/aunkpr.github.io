      <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="div2">
      <p>Hello everyone! My name is <strong>Alexandra Newman</strong>. I have a bachelor’s degree in Art History and am pursuing a Master’s in Library Information Science (MLIS). I am a Children's and Youth Services Manager for a public library in Northwest Arkansas and have worked in public libraries for 5 years.<br>This will be my first interaction with website development. I hope to gain new web design and development skills that I can directly apply to library programming for my community. In my current role, I am in charge of creating special programs that sometimes involve customizing websites to accommodate specific program needs. This course will allow me to gain a foundational understanding of these resources and become more confident when interacting with them. Surprisingly enough, I am not an avid reader. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, painting, hiking, biking, dancing, and spending time with my partner and two dogs, Thea and Veador.</p>
      <br> 
      <p>I am pursuing a Master’s in library and information science (MLIS) at the University of Missouri. In 2017, I worked as a Library Assistant at The Vandenberg Village Library in Lompoc, California. After a year I was promoted to the Library Branch Manager role. Once I moved to Arkansas in 2019 and receiving my BA in Art history in 2021 from the University of Arkansas, I became a Library Assistant for the youth services department at The Bella Vista Public Library. In 2022 I became the full time Children’s and Youth Services Manager and am looking to grow into my new position and receive the official Children’s Librarian title I filled. As I pursue my MLIS, I hope to gear my degree towards youth services and archival studies. I am expected to graduate my program in spring of 2024. This path will allow me to continue using my creative capabilities while expanding my knowledge of library specific information systems that I can directly apply to my current position.</p>
