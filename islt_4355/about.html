          <p>Hello everyone! My name is <strong>Alexandra Newman</strong>. I have a bachelor’s degree in Art History and am pursuing a Master’s in Library Information Science (MLIS). I am a Children's and Youth Services Manager for a public library in Northwest Arkansas and have worked in public libraries for 5 years. <br>This will be my first interaction with website development. I hope to gain new web design and development skills that I can directly apply to library programming for my community. In my current role, I am in charge of creating special programs that sometimes involve customizing websites to accommodate specific program needs. This course will allow me to gain a foundational understanding of these resources and become more confident when interacting with them. Surprisingly enough, I am not an avid reader. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, painting, hiking, biking, dancing, and spending time with my partner and two dogs, Thea and Veador. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I am pursuing a Master’s in library and information science (MLIS) at the University of Missouri. In 2017, I worked as a Library Assistant at The Vandenberg Village Library in Lompoc, California. After a year I was promoted to the Library Branch Manager role. Once I moved to Arkansas in 2019 and receiving my BA in Art history in 2021 from the University of Arkansas, I became a Library Assistant for the youth services department at The Bella Vista Public Library. In 2022 I became the full time Children’s and Youth Services Manager and am looking to grow into my new position and receive the official Children’s Librarian title I filled. As I pursue my MLIS, I hope to gear my degree towards youth services and archival studies. I am expected to graduate my program in the Summer term of 2024. This path will allow me to continue using my creative capabilities while expanding my knowledge of library specific information systems that I can directly apply to my current position.</p>
