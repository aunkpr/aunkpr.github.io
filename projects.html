    <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>As a Childrenâ€™s and Youth Services Manager for a public library, I am in charge of planning and 
          managing a Summer Reading Program. It is a yearly 6-week long program that promotes continued literacy 
          for all age groups through the summer months. It is a big project that serves our city/county patrons 
          and usually takes a long time to plan. During this time there are multiple programs and events planned 
          every week. There are community partnerships with at we work with to support local groups. Vendors are 
          also invited to put on new enriching and educational opportunities for our patrons. The Summer Reading 
          Program theme for 2022 was Oceans of Possibilities. It was my first year putting on the program and I 
          learned a great deal organizing</p>

      <h2>Collection Development</h2>
          <p> As a children's librarian specializing in collection development, my role is to curate a
            collection of materials that meet the unique needs and interests of the young patrons in my community.
            One of my primary goals is to ensure that our collection is diverse, inclusive, and representative of 
            the children we serve. To achieve this, I regularly conduct needs assessments, survey our patrons, and 
            solicit feedback from teachers, parents, and other community members. I also stay up-to-date on emerging 
            trends and topics in children's literature, and work to add materials that feature characters and 
            themes that reflect a range of cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. It is my belief that a diverse
             and inclusive collection is essential to fostering a love of reading and learning in children, and 
             I take great pride in my work to ensure that our collection meets this goal.</p>

          <h2>Leadership Advocacy</h2>
          <p>I recognized the importance of creating a space for teens to have a voice in the services and 
            programming we offer. That's why I decided to create a teen advisory board for our public library. 
            I worked to recruit a diverse group of teens from the community who were passionate about reading, 
            learning, and advocating for their peers. Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, we were 
            able to collaborate on new programming ideas, suggest materials to add to our collection, and provide 
            feedback on the services we offer. Not only did this help us to better serve our teen patrons, but it 
            also helped to empower these young adults and give them a sense of ownership over their library. It was 
            incredibly rewarding to see the impact that this advisory board had on our programming and services, 
            and I believe it will continue to be a valuable resource for years to come.</p>
